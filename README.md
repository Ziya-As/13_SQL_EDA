# Notes

## Intro

This is a SQL Exploratory Data Analysis project. The project involves querying the database, using aliases for table names, `JOIN`s, `UNION`s, subqueries, ranking using the window functions, aggregate functions, grouping, ordering, and limiting the result set, and using date functions.

It could be coded along following this video:  
[SQL Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project | Full Hands-On Portfolio Project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cJ5Ji8zSDg)

My code differs from the video, as I implemented this project in PostgreSQL, whereas the tutorial is based on a different SQL Database Management System.

## Project Details

The project starts with creating 3 tables and importing 3 datasets into these tables: 2 dimension tables and 1 fact table. The project proceeds with

- Database exploration that involves listing all the tables in the database, specifically checking all the user-created tables, listing all the columns in the database, and checking the columns in all the user-created tables,
- Dimension exploration that involves reviewing different details of the data such as countries that our customers come from, categories, subcategories, and product names in the products table,
- Date exploration that involves finding the date of the first and last order, finding the youngest and oldest customer,
- Measures exploration that involves finding the total sales, how many items are sold, the average selling price, the total number of orders, the total number of products, the total number of customers, and the total number of customers that have placed an order.

After exploring different aspects of the data, I generate a report that shows all key metrics of the business such as total sales, total quantity sold, average price, total number of orders, total number of products, and total number of customers.

The project proceeds with a magnitude analysis, where I compare different dimensions of the data by showing

- total customers by countries,
- total customers by gender,
- total products by category,
- average costs in each category,
- total revenue generated for each category,
- total revenue generated by each customer, and
- distribution of sold items across countries.

The project concludes with a ranking analysis that involves listing:

- 5 products that generate the highest revenue,
- 5 products that generate the lowest revenue,
- 5 subcategories that generate the highest revenue,
- 10 customers who have generated the highest revenue, and
- 3 customers with the fewest orders placed.
